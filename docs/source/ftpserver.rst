FTP Server
==========

FTP or File Transfer Protocol is TCP based service. We use FTP to upload or download their files to server. By default FTP use 2 ports, which is port 20 and 21. Port 21 for "command port" and port 20 for "data port".

In this documentation we use Ubuntu 14.04 as operating system, and vsftpd as ftp server.
